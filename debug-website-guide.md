# üîç Website Blank Screen Debugging Guide

Since the deployment was already triggered yesterday, let's find the real root cause.

## Step 1: Check JavaScript Console Errors

**Open your browser and navigate to kpmed.de, then:**

1. Press `F12` or right-click ‚Üí "Inspect Element"
2. Go to the **Console** tab
3. Refresh the page (`F5`)
4. Look for any **red error messages**

**Common errors to look for:**
- `TypeError: Cannot read property...`
- `ReferenceError: ... is not defined`
- `Failed to load resource: 404`
- `CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin'`
- `ChunkLoadError` or bundle loading failures

## Step 2: Check Network Tab

1. In DevTools, go to **Network** tab
2. Refresh the page
3. Look for any **failed requests (red entries)**

**Check specifically for:**
- Main JavaScript bundle (should be ~5MB based on our build)
- Any 404 errors on assets
- Failed API calls to Supabase
- Environment variable loading issues

## Step 3: Check Application Tab

1. Go to **Application** tab in DevTools
2. Check **Local Storage** and **Session Storage**
3. Look for any service worker errors
4. Check if any cached data is corrupting the app

## Step 4: Test with Clean Browser State

1. Open an **Incognito/Private browsing** window
2. Navigate to kpmed.de
3. See if the issue persists (this rules out cache issues)

## Step 5: Check Mobile vs Desktop

1. Test on different devices/browsers
2. Use DevTools device emulation
3. Check if it's a responsive design issue

## Common Causes Based on Our Setup:

### A) Environment Variables Missing
- Supabase URL/keys not set in Netlify
- App fails to initialize without proper config

### B) React Router/Expo Router Issues
- Route configuration problems
- Hash vs browser history routing conflicts

### C) Authentication Context Errors
- Our new auth checks might be causing initialization loops
- AuthContext failing to load properly

### D) Bundle Loading Issues
- JavaScript bundle corrupted or too large
- CDN delivery problems

### E) Supabase Connection Problems
- RLS policies blocking even the initial app load
- Network connectivity issues to Supabase

## Report Back With:

Please run through Steps 1-2 and tell me:
1. **Any console error messages** (copy the exact text)
2. **Any failed network requests** (which files/URLs failed)
3. **Whether incognito mode works differently**

This will help pinpoint the exact issue!
